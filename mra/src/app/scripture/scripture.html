  For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when <br>
  it is past, and as a watch in the night. <br>

  But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day <br>
  is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as <br>
  one day. <br>

  And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, <br>
  that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its <br>
  times and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one <br>
  revolution was a day unto the Lord, after his manner of <br>
  reckoning, it being one thousand years according to the time <br>
  appointed unto that whereon thou standest. This is the <br>
  reckoning of the Lord&#39;s time, according to the reckoning of <br>
  Kolob. <br>
